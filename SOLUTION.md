## Architecture Overview

### PartsTracker

The system is built as a parts tracking API with the following key components:

1. **Data Layer**
   - Uses Entity Framework Core as the ORM
   - Implements a DbContext (PartsDbContext) for database operations
   - Uses Code-First approach with entity configurations
   - Includes seed data for initial parts inventory

2. **Domain Model**
   - Core entity: Part
   - Key attributes: PartNumber (PK), Description, QuantityOnHand, LocationCode, LastStockTake
   - Implements inventory tracking with location management

3. **API Layer**
   - RESTful API design
   - Built with ASP.NET Core
   - Provides CRUD operations for parts management

## Trade-offs

1. **ORM Choice (Entity Framework Core)**
   - Pros:
     - Rapid development with built-in migration support
     - Type-safe queries
     - Rich querying capabilities
   - Cons:
     - Potential performance overhead compared to raw SQL
     - Learning curve for complex queries
     - Memory overhead for tracking entities

2. **Data Model Design**
   - Pros:
     - Simple, focused schema
     - Efficient queries with PartNumber as primary key - should ideally be an int though.
   - Cons:
     - Limited historical tracking
     - No built-in audit trail
     - Single-table design may need expansion for complex scenarios

## Security (TODOs)

1. **Data Access**
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Use HTTPS for all API communications
   - Implement API authentication using JWT or API keys
   - Add rate limiting for API endpoints

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Implement audit logging for all inventory changes
   - Regular security scans and updates
   - Input validation for all API endpoints

## Monitoring (TODOs)

1. **Application Monitoring**
   - Implement health checks for API and database (TODO)
   - Set up performance metrics tracking
   - Monitor API response times
   - Track database query performance

2. **Business Metrics**
   - Monitor inventory levels
   - Track stock movements
   - Alert on low stock conditions
   - Report on inventory accuracy

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Database performance metrics
   - Server resource utilization
   - Network latency monitoring
   - Regular backup verification

## Cost

1. **Infrastructure Costs**
   - Database hosting costs
   - API hosting costs
   - Backup storage costs
   - Monitoring solution costs

2. **Optimization Strategies**
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed parts
   - Use appropriate database scaling options
   - Optimize query performance
   - Consider read replicas for reporting

3. **Maintenance Costs**
   - Regular database maintenance
   - Application updates and patches
   - Security audits and updates
   - Developer maintenance time
